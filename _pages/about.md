Hello! I'm Nick, 

# My Journey
From self taught artist to aspiring software engineer.

### A Creative Pursuit
##### 2012-2017

Before programming, I had art. I was always drawing as a kid, and eventually I gained a nack for it. I applied and got accepted to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) with a scholarship.

Unfortunately, time at SAIC was short and tumultuous. [Need to put a positive spin on dropping out haha].

### The Rebuild
#### 2017-2021
At home, 

### Pursuing my Passion
#### 2021-Present
Now I am currently working to earn my Bachelor's degree in Game Programming at the Academy of Art University. Through hard work and mentorship from the industry professionals that teach there, I was given the opportunity to attend GDC 2023 in person.

# ðŸŽˆThe Fun Stuff!ðŸŽˆ
### Favorite Game?
Like all game lovers, this answer varies. But if I had to choose a handlful of formative titles that made
me take the jump to pursue a career in games, it would be 
- *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim*
- *Bastion* (Or basically any game by SuperGiant)
- *Donkey Kong 64*
- *God of War (2018) & Ragnarok* 
- *Sekiro, Shadows Die Twice*

Notable mention to *Elden Ring*, which I am playing right now and could be one of my favorites of all time.

    *I imagine future Nick is screaming "You forgot about [x]!!!"*

### Outside of Games?
When I am not programming or playing games, one of the things I do to keep myself active is distance running! My aim is to run a marathon someday!

When I need a creative break, I like to draw, digitally or on paper. I am a bit rusty these days, but sometimes I need that creative endeavor to refocus and repair.

Also, I am a huge Everton Football Club fan, though I don't know if it is a curse or blessing ðŸ˜…. Every weekend I am getting up early to watch the Premier League.
