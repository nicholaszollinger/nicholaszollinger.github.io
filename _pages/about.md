Hello! I'm Nick and I'm a software engineer in the gaming industry who enjoys making art when I can!

### Pursuing my Passion
Now I am currently working to earn my Bachelor's degree in Game Programming at the Academy of Art University. Through hard work and mentorship from the industry professionals that teach there, I was given the opportunity to attend GDC 2023 in person!

# 👾GAMES!👾
Gaming holds immense importance to me due to its capacity to allow us to experience and explore worlds and perspectives beyond our own. I find myself deeply engrossed in the puzzles they present, whether it's crafting the perfect character build, finding all the juicy secrets and collectibles, spotting the patterns in a boss to defeat them, or just figuring out “how the heck do I get over there???”. Each game is a new adventure, a new problem to solve, and a new experience to immerse myself in.

I play a variety of games, depending on the headspace that I am in. Some days, I want delve into the challenging and remarkable worlds of titles such as FromSoftware's **Elden Ring**, where my concentration, tact and reflexes are challenged to their fullest. Some days I just want to be taken along for an adventure in more cinematic titles like Santa Monica's **God of War Ragnorok** or Sucker Punch's **Ghost of Tsushima**. Other times, I want just want some good ol' platforming in titles like **Spyro** or **Donkey Kong 64** where I can scoop up collectibles and chip my way at getting 100% completion. And even though it sounds silly, when I need to turn my brain off and chill, a bit of **Powerwash Simulator** with a podcast in the background is a great time.

# 🎨ART!🎨
Before programming, I had art. I was always drawing as a kid, and eventually I gained a nack for it. I applied and got accepted to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) with a scholarship. I still try to draw make art when I can as a hobby, but I found new passion in programming!

# 👀WHAT ELSE???👀
Outside of programming and art, one of the things I do to keep myself active is distance running! My aim is to run a marathon someday!  

I am a huge Everton Football Club fan, though I don't know if it is a curse or blessing 😅. NSNO!
