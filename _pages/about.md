Hello! I'm Nick, a software engineer in the video game industry!

# 💼 Career Journey 💼

# 👾GAMES!👾
I love how games as an artistic medium have capacity to allow us to experience and explore worlds and perspectives beyond our own. I love the puzzles they present- crafting the perfect character build, finding all the juicy secrets and collectibles, spotting the patterns in a boss to defeat them. Each game is a new adventure, a new problem to solve, and a new experience to immerse myself in.

**Games In Progress** ⌛
- Hollow Knight: Silksong
- Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (I have put 500+ hours into this game, but never got all of the achievements!).

**Favorites** ⭐
- Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim
- Elden Ring
- Any Pokemon Game 😅 (I really liked Pokemon Z-A!)
- Donkey Kong Bananza
- Tunic
- SSX3 (I beg for a remake 🙏)
- Balatro
- Fire Emblem: Awakening
- Super Mario Strikers: Charged
- Ghost of Yotei
- Bastion (and basically anything Supergiant Games makes)
- ...and soooo many more!!!

# 🎨ART!🎨
Before programming, I had art. I was always drawing as a kid, and eventually I gained a nack for it. I applied and got accepted to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) with a scholarship. I still try to draw make art when I can as a hobby, but I found a new passion in programming!
