## Motivation
The basic idea for this game was to thread the needle between **EA's FC (formerly FIFA)** series and one of my favorite games as a kid: **Super Mario Strikers Charged**!

For my taste, **FC** has some incredible mechanics, but the pursuit of making it feel more an more like a simulation game has left the movement feeling a bit rigid, clunky and frustrating at times when you compare in game animations or referee decisions to the real world. 

On the other hand, **Super Mario Strikers**' movement is way more snappy, there are *no refs* (crowd goes wild), and the chaos of items and "super moves" adds a lot of fun to the experience. However, I miss some of the dribbling mechanics and player progression in the FIFA series.

***Enter in: Project Soccer!*** (The title is temporary ðŸ˜…)

## Goals
- Replicate the basic movement, passing, shooting, and tackling from **Super Mario Strikers**.
- Robust Debugging Tools & Visualizations for gleaning insights about the team and field states.
- ( *Future* ) Add in the "Nimble strafing", "Protect the Ball", and "Sprinting" dribble modes from FIFA
- ( *Future* ) Jumping!!! Aerial shots & passes, using the Jump to dodge certain supers, this could be a lot of fun!
- ( *Future* ) Different characters, with "plug and play" supers and attributes that can be unlocked and equipped.
