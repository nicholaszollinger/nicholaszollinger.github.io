The Nessie Engine is my playground project where I can learn, practice and explore engine and lower-level programming topics that interest me! It is written
in C++20 (I'm a big fan of concepts).
- You can find the project on Github using the link on the right!

# What I am Working On:
### Immediate:
This Fall, the aim is finish rendering features and create the Editor UI!
- Renderer Refactor - Vulkan Abstraction âŒ›
    - PBR Pipeline
    - Shadows
- ECS refactor - wrapping Entt.
- Editor UI - using ImGui.
- 3D Demo Scene showing off features!

### Next Year (Unless I can get to these sooner):
- Full Jolt Physics Integration
- Exporting a final executable.
- Proper Serialization - utilizing a binary format.
- UI System.
- Audio System.
- Scripting, in python (lower priority, as I will be the solo dev for this engine).
