The Nessie Engine is my playground project where I can learn, practice and explore engine and lower-level programming topics that interest me! It is written
in C++20 (I'm a big fan of concepts).
- You can find the project on Github using the link on the right!

# What I am Working On:
### Immediate:
Over the summer, I am going to be doing some project-wide refactors, with the aim of getting a Physics Test scene up and running!
- New Syntax Rules ✅
- Refactor Math classes with SIMD operations. ✅
- Refactor Logging & Profiling code to be more robust. ✅
- Port Asset System Work from last semester. ✅
- Finish basic Physics System ✅
- Renderer Refactor, Render Thread, Debug Rendering API. ⌛
- Create a Physics Test with boxes falling on each other.

### Fall Goals:
Overall, I plan on having the basic structure to make small demos using my engine. Being able to load a project, edit and run all in the editor.
- Asset System overhaul; multithreaded architecture.
- ECS revisit.
- Editor UI
- Engine vs Game Applications

### Next Year (Unless I can get to these sooner):
- Proper Serialization - utilizing a binary format.
- UI
- Sound
- Scripting, in python (lower priority, as I will be the solo dev for this engine).
