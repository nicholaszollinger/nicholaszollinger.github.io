The Nessie Engine is my playground project where I can learn, practice and explore engine and lower-level programming topics that interest me! Eventually, it would be rad to get the engine to be capable of creating small 3D platfrom games, but that has to wait until I can venture further into graphics programming!

- You can find the project on Github using the link on the right!

I jumped to writing this in C++20 almost entirely because of the introduction of `concepts`. I have also setup the project to use the new `modules` file type, but the jury is still out whether I think they are better or worse that the classic `.hpp` and `.cpp` files. I haven't seen a significant compile time benefit just yet.

[TODO]: Link to a Wiki or something?
