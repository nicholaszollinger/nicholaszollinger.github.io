The Nessie Engine is my playground project where I can learn, practice and explore engine and lower-level programming topics that interest me! It is written
in C++20 (I'm a big fan of concepts).
- You can find the project on Github using the link on the right!

## Goals:
- Build System written in Premake âœ…
- Implement a Collision system while reading "Real-Time Collision Detection" by Christer Ericson.
- Implement OpenGL and/or Vulkan Renderer alongside my upcoming Graphics class in Spring 2025 semester.
