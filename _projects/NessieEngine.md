The Nessie Engine is my playground project where I can learn, practice and explore engine and lower-level programming topics that interest me! It is written
in C++20 (I'm a big fan of concepts).
- You can find the project on Github using the link on the right!

# What I am Working On:
### Immediate:
Over the summer, I am going to be doing some project-wide refactors, updating syntax/naming rules and splitting the code-base into smaller projects so that I can more easily maintain the system.
- New Syntax Rules ✅
- Refactor Math classes with SIMD operations ✅
- Refactor Logging & Profiling code to be more robust. ✅
- Finish basic Physics System, with demo of different types of collisions

### Fall Goals:
- Port Asset System and Graphics work from my Graphics class assignments.
- Render Thread
- Asset Thread
- Polish ECS
- Engine vs Game Applications

### Next Year (Unless I can get to these sooner):
- Proper Serialization - utilizing a binary format.
- UI
- Sound
- Scripting, in python (lower priority, as I will be the solo dev for this engine).
